## Purpose

#### What is Splunk Enterprise?
[Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-enterprise.html) is a platform for operational intelligence. Our software lets you collect, analyze, and act upon the untapped value of big data that your technology infrastructure, security systems, and business applications generate. It gives you insights to drive operational performance and business results.

See [Splunk Products](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software.html) for more information about the features and capabilities of Splunk products and how you can [bring them into your organization](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/enterprise-data-platform.html).

#### What is Splunk-Ansible?
The Splunk-Ansible project is a collection of Splunk configuration best practices, written as Ansible scripts. These scripts, called playbooks, can be used for configuring Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder instances based on a declarative configuration.

The playbooks in this codebase are internally-vetted procedures and operations that administer and manage Splunk as done within the company. Use Splunk-Ansible to manage Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Universal Forwarder instances in a manner consistent with industry standards, such as infrastructure automation and infrastructure-as-code.
